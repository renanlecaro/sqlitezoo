- title: Introduction
  intro: >-
    This website will teach you SQL from 0. We already set up a database for
    you, it lists all the countries in the world. You can resize the 3 panels on
    the page by dragging the corners at the bottom of the screen. You can suggest
    changes to the exercises by heading to https://github.com/renanlecaro/sqlitezoo
  goal: >-
    Click the "run query" button below to see the result, then click "next
    exercise".
  db_name: world.sql
  start_query: SELECT * FROM world
  solution_query: SELECT * FROM world
- title: Only output some columns
  intro: >-
    The world table has many columns, so we might need to scroll horizontally to
    see them all in the result pane. And easier way would be to restrict the
    output to only what we need. This can be achieved by specifying columns in
    the SELECT clause.
  goal: >-
    Change the select below to only list the name and population of each
    country.
  db_name: world.sql
  start_query: 'SELECT name, population, continent FROM world'
  solution_query: 'SELECT name, population FROM world'
- title: Only output some rows
  intro: You can add a WHERE column with a condition to avoid listing all rows.
  goal: Change the select below to only list the name and population of 'France'.
  db_name: world.sql
  start_query: 'SELECT name, population FROM world WHERE name=''Germany'''
  solution_query: 'SELECT name, population FROM world WHERE name=''France'''
- title: Lists possible values for a column
  intro: >-
    The word IN allows us to check if an item is in a list. The example shows
    the name and population for the countries 'Brazil', 'Russia', 'India' and
    'China'.
  goal: 'Show the name and the population for ''Sweden'', ''Norway'' and ''Denmark''.'
  db_name: world.sql
  start_query: >-
    SELECT name, population FROM world WHERE name IN ('Brazil', 'Russia',
    'India', 'China');
  solution_query: >-
    SELECT name, population FROM world WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway' and
    'Denmark');
- title: Filter values by interval
  intro: >-
    Which countries are not too small and not too big? BETWEEN allows range
    checking (range specified is inclusive of boundary values).The example below
    shows countries with an area of 250,000-300,000 sq. km.
  goal: >-
    Show the country and the area for countries with an area between 200,000 and
    250,000
  db_name: world.sql
  start_query: 'SELECT name, area FROM world WHERE area BETWEEN 250000 AND 300000'
  solution_query: 'SELECT name, area FROM world  WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000'
- title: A full select statement
  intro: Let's see if you can type a full select yourself.
  goal: >-
    Show the name for the countries that have a population of at least 200
    million.
  db_name: world.sql
  start_query: ''
  solution_query: SELECT name FROM world WHERE population > 200000000

- title: Computing new columns
  intro: >-
    The select can compute new columns base on what's already in the table. Here
    for example we're computing the population density. You can add an "as" command to rename the resulting column, here we're calling it population_density.
  goal: >-
    Give the name and the per capita GDP (name it gdp_per_capita) of all
    countries with a population of at least 200 million.
  db_name: world.sql
  start_query: 'SELECT name, population/area as population_density FROM world'
  solution_query: >-
    SELECT name, gdp/population as gdp_per_capita FROM world WHERE population >
    200000000

- title: Decimals and rounding
  intro: >-
    When you do a division of integers, the output is automatically rounded. To avoid this, add a .0 at the end of one of the numbers. You may want to round results a bit though, 
    the ROUND function can remove decimals to make the output look cleaner.
  goal: >-
    Show the name and population in millions (with 2 decimals, named "pop") for the countries of the continent 'South America'.
  db_name: world.sql
  start_query: 'SELECT name, ROUND(gdp/1000000000.0, 2) as gdp  FROM world'
  solution_query: 'SELECT name, ROUND( population / 1000000.0, 2) as pop  FROM world'

- title: AND and OR
  intro: >-
    In your where statement, you can combine multiple conditions. Here we show
    "big" countries that have a large population (greater than 40 millions), OR
    a large area (greater than 2 million square km)
  goal: >-
    Modify the query to find tiny crowded countries, with less the 1000 square
    km of surface AND more than 1 million inhabitants.
  db_name: world.sql
  start_query: SELECT name, population, area  FROM world WHERE population>40000000 OR area >2000000
  solution_query: SELECT name, population, area FROM world WHERE population>1000000 AND area <1000

- title: Partial string matches with like
  intro: >-
    You can match countries following a "like" condition. Below, the condition is set to show countries who's capital starts with an S. 
    The '%' character in a like condition can match any text.
  goal: >-
    Show the countries names which include the word 'United'
  db_name: world.sql
  start_query: SELECT capital  FROM world WHERE capital like 'S%'
  solution_query: SELECT name  FROM world WHERE name like '%United%'

- title: Merging text with ||
  intro: >-
    You can concatenate text using the  || operator in SQLite. Other databases use the CONCAT() function, but it's not availiable in this RDBMS
  goal: >-
    Show the capital of each country. For example "The capital of France is Paris".
  db_name: world.sql
  start_query: SELECT 'The population of ' || name || ' is ' || population  FROM world
  solution_query: SELECT 'The capital of ' || name || ' is ' || capital  FROM world

- title: Merging text in like queries
  intro: >-
    You can concatenate text to generate a dynamic condition for the like.
  goal: >-
    Show the name and capital of countries who's capital contain the country name. For example, "Mexico city" contains "Mexico"
  db_name: world.sql
  start_query: SELECT name, capital FROM world WHERE capital like '%' || 'Mexico' || '%'
  solution_query: SELECT name, capital FROM world WHERE capital like '%' || name || '%'

- title: Strings length
  intro: >-
    Greece has capital Athens. Each of the strings 'Greece', and 'Athens' has 6 characters.
  goal: >-
    Show the name and capital where the name and the capital have the same number of characters.
  db_name: world.sql
  start_query: SELECT name, LENGTH(name), capital, LENGTH(capital) FROM world
  solution_query:  SELECT name, capital FROM world WHERE LENGTH(name) = LENGTH(capital)

- title: Substring function
  intro: >-
    The capital of Sweden is Stockholm. Both words start with the letter 'S'. 
    The SQLite substr function returns a substring from a string starting at a specified position with a predefined length.
    The syntax is substr( string, start, length ) 
    If the start is a positive integer, the  substr() function returns a substring starting from the beginning of the string. The first character has an index of 1.
    If the start is a negative integer, the returned substring consists of the length number of character starting from the end of the string. The last character has an index of -1.

  goal: >-
    Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match. Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same word.
  db_name: world.sql
  start_query: SELECT name, substr(name,1,1) as first_letter,substr(name,-1,1) as last_letter FROM world
  solution_query:  SELECT name, capital FROM world WHERE substr(name,1,1) = substr(capital,1,1) AND name!=capital

- title: Not like
  intro: >-
    You can use not like to find strings that do not contain a substring.
  goal: >-
    Show the name of countries that have a space but no letter A.
  db_name: world.sql
  start_query: SELECT name FROM world WHERE name NOT LIKE '%A%'
  solution_query: SELECT name FROM world WHERE name NOT LIKE '%A%' AND name LIKE '% %'
