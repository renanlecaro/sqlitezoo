<h1>Only output some columns </h1>

<p>
    The world table has many columns, so we might need to scroll horizontally to see them all in the result pane.
    And easier way would be to restrict the output to only what we need. This can be achieved by specifying columns
    in the SELECT clause.

<p><strong>Change the select below to only list the name and population of each country. </strong></p>

<textarea id="codeInput" data-db="world.sql">
SELECT name, population, continent FROM world
</textarea> 

<div id="solution">SELECT name, population FROM world</div>
