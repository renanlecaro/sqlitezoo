<h1>AND and OR </h1>

<p>In your where statement, you can combine multiple conditions.
    Here we show "big" countries that have a large population (greater than 40 millions),
    OR a large area (greater than 2 million square km)
</p>

Modify the query to find tiny crowded countries, with less the 1000 square km of surface AND more than 2 million inhabitants.
